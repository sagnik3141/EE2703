        "Reinforcement learning is an approach used in Machine Learning where the agent is allowed to interact with the system to learn its behaviour and come up with an optimal startegy to achieve an objective. The agent models the problem as a probabilistic state machine (a graph where the transition from one node to another has a probability distribution). Nodes in the model graph are called states and a transition from one state to another is called an action. Each state transition (which is a (state, action) pair) has a corresponding reward or penalty. The goal of the RL agent is to maximise the reward. \n",
        "\n",
        "Training an RL agent from scratch requires us to model the state space and the action space. In addition, we must also come up with suitable rewards for each state transition. The RL agent estimates this reward structure and executes actions so as to maximise them. The final performance of the RL agent is heavily dependent on how the system is modelled. Luckily for us, we **do not need to get into the mathematics** of Reinforcement Learning right now, thanks to the Python library Gym.\n",
